During my master's at AIMS, I presented on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) as part of the Computer Vision class, where I explored the core concepts and applications of GANs in generating realistic images.

This project will be an extension of that presentation, where I will implement a GAN to generate synthetic handwritten digits.

Through this project, I aim to :

- Develop a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic handwritten digits resembling those in the MNIST dataset.
- Explore the foundational principles of generative models.
- Focus on how GANs learn to create new, realistic data based on training examples.
- Gain hands-on experience with GAN architecture and training processes.
